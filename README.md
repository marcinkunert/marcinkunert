### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my name is Marcin Kunert. I'm currently based in Wroclaw, Poland :poland:.

I'm a small business owner of [JavaStart.pl](https://javastart.pl), where we, together with my business partner, teach programming.

My current points of interests are:

- Java
- DevOps
- Selfhosting

I was also active in Android Development, but the interest in this techology faded a bit.

ðŸ“« The best way to reach me would be Twitter: @qunerd, or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcinkunert/)
